        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a student at JMU with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Information Systems graduating in 2026. Currently I am working on a mobile application that is built using React Native along with Google Firebase to engage a community with events and groups around their area. Always looking for ways to expand my skills into something that benefits others.</p>
